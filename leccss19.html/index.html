    Maharana Pratap was born to Udai Singh II of Mewar and Jaiwanta Bai in 1540, the year in which Udai Singh ascended to the throne after defeating Vanvir Singh.[5][6][7] His younger brothers were Shakti Singh, Vikram Singh and Jagmal Singh. Pratap also had two stepsisters: Chand Kanwar and Man Kanwar. 
    His chief consort was Ajabde Bai Punwar of Bijolia.[8] Their eldest son was Amar Singh I.[9] He belonged to the royal family of Mewar.[10] After the death of Udai Singh in 1572, Rani Dheer Bai Bhatiyani wanted her son Jagmal to succeed him[11] but senior courtiers preferred Pratap, as the eldest son, to be their king. The desire of the nobles prevailed and Pratap ascended the throne as Maharana Pratap, the 54th ruler of Mewar in the line of the Sisodia Rajputs.[12] He was crowned in Gogunda on the auspicious day of Holi. Jagmal swore revenge and left for Ajmer, to join the armies of Emperor Akbar who later gave him a portion of Sirohi.
