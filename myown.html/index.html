          he has lots of busy time . He loves to irritate me , roast me nd be ready for that. He is good at preparing a bday butmostly  low at other days.
          He loves Rohit Sharma and majorly the whole cricket team. He is a noob now in cricket since has no practice .Recently have been a gymrat too.
          He doesnt like no reason calls,he runs from lil inconvineance,be brave . He is a gamer too.. a nice one for like 5 to 6 yrs . Not looking while being friend wd me but lucky enough to 
          have good friends fron childhood ,his cricket gang,class buddy,d forever person.
          He is hard while having convos but good at supporting if u shall be his priorty for every sitution ,u r lucky!
          he shall there when u need him buty sucks at emotion understanding.
          I really want to make up for the thing happend in the following year .
          I never wanted to be the reason for his cry ,he did so much that no one or I have done for him.
          I regret about being called my friendship as cheap and I shall never forget that ,this is my life's greatest lose!
          I know I know you might be irritated on my words and u say Shreya hogya cuz i yapp alot.
